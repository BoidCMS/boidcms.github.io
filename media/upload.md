File Manager is a powerful feature of BoidCMS that enables administrators to upload and store files on their website.     
This feature is useful for managing various types of files such as images, videos, documents, and more.

## How to upload

- Log in to your website's `Admin panel`.
- Navigate to the `Media` section.
- Click on the `Choose file/Browse` button.
- In the dialog box, select the file you want to upload.
- Click the `Upload` button to start the uploading process.

Once the upload is complete, you will see the file listed.

!> It is important to note that uploading a file with the same filename as another existing file will result in the replacement of the old file. Therefore, uploading should be done with care. To avoid the loss of older files, it is recommended that every file is renamed with a unique name before uploading.
