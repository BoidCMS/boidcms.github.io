However, if you need to upload a file type that is not listed here, you can add it using the `media_mime` and the `media_extension` [actions](/developer/actions?id=core). This allows you to specify custom file types that your website will recognize and accept. Please keep in mind that adding custom file types should be done with caution, as it can pose a security risk if not properly implemented.
