# Content types
BoidCMS comes with two content types by default.

## Post
This could be an article/blog post, or whatever the case may be. It's listed in the homepage as a post.

## Page
This is a static page that can be accessed via link, but which is hidden inside the website. It could be added anywhere in the content or placed in a block such as the navigation bar or footer to make it visible.
