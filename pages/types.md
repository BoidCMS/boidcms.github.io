# Content types
BoidCMS has two content types by default.    

## Post
This could be an article/blog post or whatever, it is listed in the homepage as post.

## Page
This is a static page that is accessible through link but hidden inside the website, could be added inside article content or in a block such as navigation bar or footer to make it visible.
