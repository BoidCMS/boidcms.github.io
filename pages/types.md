# Content Types
BoidCMS includes two default content types that are readily available. However, it also offers [actions](/developer/actions) that allow you to create your own custom page types.


## Post
Posts are dynamic content items that are typically used for articles, blog posts, news updates, or any other kind of time-sensitive content that gets added to your website over time. They are listed on your homepage as individual posts. <!-- and can be sorted by date, or other criteria.-->

## Page
Pages are static content items that are used for content that doesn't change frequently, such as an "About Us" page, a "Contact Us" page, or a page with specific information that you want to share with your visitors. Pages can be accessed through a link, but they are not listed on your homepage. You can add them to the website navigation menu, footer, or any other section of your website to make them more visible to your visitors.
