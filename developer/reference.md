# API Reference


## Global Variables
To access a global variable in your code, you need to first declare it as a global variable using the syntax `global $variable;`. 

- **`$App` (`object`)**:
This is the global instance of the `App` class.

### Admin Global Variables

- **`$page` (`string`)**:
This is the slug of the page being visited (current page) in the admin area.

- **`$action` (`string`)**:
This is a reserved variable that can be used as a sub-action slug.

- **`$layout` (`array`)**:
This variable contains the layout data for the admin panel.

## Constants

- **`App` (`bool`)**:
The `App` constant, defined in the `index.php` file located in the root directory, serves as a security measure to prevent direct access to PHP files. To enforce this restriction, use the following syntax or an alternative method:

```php
defined( 'App' ) or die( 'Direct access to this file is restricted.' );
```
