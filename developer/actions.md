# Actions
In BoidCMS, the term `Actions` encompasses both [`Events`](/developer/plugin-api?id=event) and [`Filters`](/developer/plugin-api?id=filter).

Developers can extend the functionality of their site using a variety of actions offered by BoidCMS. These actions include those utilized in plugins and themes, as well as those integrated into the core itself.

Here is a list of all the actions.
