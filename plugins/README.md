# List of Plugins

One of the powerful features of BoidCMS is its ability to support plugins. Plugins are add-ons that you can install and activate to extend the functionality of your website beyond the core features of the CMS.

Plugins can be used to add new features, improve existing ones, or customize your website's appearance. BoidCMS may not be as vast as some other CMS platforms, there are still several high-quality plugins, from simple ones that add RSS Feed to complex plugins that add RESTful API functionality.
